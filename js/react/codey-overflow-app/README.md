# CodeyOverflow Forum App
This project was completed as part of the CodeCademy React course.

The goal of the project was to build the beginnings of a web forum called CodeyOverflow using React.js. In this project the main focus was on the comment components.

## Outcome
While building this project I learnt more about using props as well as defining, rendering, and referencing React components.

Note: This project is not meant for installing and viewing locally - I have uploaded this project to GitHub as a useful React project reference.
