# Writing Tests Using Mocha
In this project I was provided with the index.js file and was required to write a number of tests for the functions in that file, using the Mocha test framework and Node assert methods.

## Outcome
During this project I learnt a lot about writing tests with the Mocha framework in conjunction with Node assert methods and how to write tests that are *fast, complete, reliable, isolated, maintainable* and *expressive*. I am looking forward to writing more testing suites in the future - hoping I can use what I have learnt to try out TDD (Test Driven Development).

## Usage
To try out this project for yourself follow these steps:
1. download all files inside the 'mocha-tests-for-rooster-project' folder.
2. run ``npm install`` to install dependencies
3. run ``npm test`` to run the test suite
