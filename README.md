# Practice Projects
In this repo you will find a collection of small projects I have worked on during my journey to becoming a Full-Stack Engineer. They are a mixture of Codecademy and personal projects. 

I also thought this would be a nice way to showcase my progress and skill development over time, as well build a library of useful code snippets to refer to when I need them. 

## Folder Structre 
To keep everything organised, the projects on this repo are sorted into folders based on the primary language that was used in that project - then a project folder with a descriptive name.
E.g ``sql/designing-a-database`` is an sql project about SQL database design. 

I also want to add a README file inside each project folder to give a little more info about each project for those who are interested.

*P.S. Don't accidentally press the back button on your mouse while writing a README file in Github like I just did. You will have to start over again.
