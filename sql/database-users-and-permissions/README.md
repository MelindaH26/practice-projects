# Creating Users and Permissions in a PostreSQL Database
This project was completed as part of the Codecademy Back-End-Engineering course.

The purpose of this project was to pactice creating a new user and user group for a pre-existing database and assign permissions to those groups/users.

I have chosen to store this project on GitHub as it will be usefull to refer to in the future, or in the case that it may even be useful to others. 

Note that the statements in `database-users-and-permissions.sql` are examples and should only be used as references when creating roles or permissions for your own PostgreSQL database.
