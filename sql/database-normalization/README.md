# Normalizing a database for Fred's Furniture
This project was completed as part of the Codecademy Back-End Engineering course.

The purpose of this project was to normalize a databse for the growing business Fred's Furniture - and compare the complexity of database queries before and after the normalization.

The structure of the old database (filled with sample data) is as below:

You can see this table has a lot of columns and could be organised into multiple tables to make storing data more efficient.

The database was to be normalized based on the database schema in the image below:

At the end of the ``database-normalization.sql`` file you can see that normalization can make searches on the database either more simple or complex depending on the situation. Overall though, it is clear that the normalized version of the database is much more manageable and has better scalability than the previous version.
