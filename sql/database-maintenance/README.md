# PostgreSQL Database Maintenance Project
This project was completed as part of the Codecademy Back-End Engineering course.

The purpose of this project was to manipulate data in an already existing tables and use ``VACCUM``, ``VACUUM FULL`` and ``TRUNCATE`` as maintenance methods. Queries were run after each of these methods to compare the file size differences when working with ``VACUUM``, ``VACUUM FULL`` and ``TRUNCATE``.

I decided to upload this project as it may be handy to use as a future reference.
